# Spring-Bike-Clinic
UNDER DEVELOPMENT, NOT COMPLETE (Summer 2020)

This Spring Boot demo application is influenced by the [Spring Pet Clinic](https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-petclinic) 
reference application, though implemented with a different subject domain. It is under active development as a learning project 
while completing John Thompson's 
[Spring Framework 5: Beginner to Guru](https://www.udemy.com/spring-framework-5-beginner-to-guru/?couponCode=GITHUB_SFGPETCLINIC) 
Udemy course.
